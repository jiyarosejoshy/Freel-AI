# Freel-AI
Freelancers and clients face issues like lack of trust, delayed payments, and poor job matching. Centralized platforms charge high fees and control all interactions. This project aims to create a decentralized, AI-powered freelance marketplace where smart contracts handle payments securely and AI matches the right people to the right jobs.
